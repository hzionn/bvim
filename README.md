# quick-vim

This extension enables a small set of Vim keybindings inside text fields on
selected websites. Press `Esc` in a text area, input, or other editable element
to enter **Normal** mode and use the following commands:

- `h` / `l` &mdash; move the cursor left or right
- `j` / `k` &mdash; move the cursor down or up
- `w` &mdash; jump forward to the start of the next word
- `b` &mdash; jump backward to the start of the previous word
- `i` &mdash; return to Insert mode

Manage the list of active sites through the extension's options page.

Use the popup to toggle the extension or quickly open the options page.
A small mode indicator appears in the corner to show the current mode.
